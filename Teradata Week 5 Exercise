## Specific Goals:
## Practice using subqueries
## Practice using CASE statements and conditional logic
## Practice constructing longer queries in a step-wise fashion to address multiple computations or pieces of logic
## Practice translating real analysis questions into SQL queries
## Gain experience with how to handle “messy data” in SQL queries and analyses
## Gain an appreciation for how long it can take to design queries that address important analysis questions 

## Encouragement from mentor:
## Upon finishing the course you feel confident that you know how to work through any query you need to write in the future. 

## Warning: Teradata doesn't permit to use IF statement


## Exercise 1
## How many distinct dates are there in the saledate column of the transaction table for each month/year combination in the database? 

SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR from saledate) as year_num, EXTRACT(MONTH from saledate) as month_num, 
COUNT(DISTINCT saledate) 
FROM trnsact
GROUP BY year_num, month_num
ORDER BY year_num ASC, month_num ASC;
# There are some missing dates due to Thanksgiving (11.25), Christmas (12.25), etc

## Exercise 2 
## Use a CASE statement within an aggregate function to determine 
## which sku had the greatest total sales during the combined summer months of June, July, and August.
