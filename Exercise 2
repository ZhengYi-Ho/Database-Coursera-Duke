## Exercise 1
## (a) Use COUNT and DISTINCT to determine how many distinct skus there are in pairs of the skuinfo, skstinfo, and trnsact tables. 
## Which skus are common to pairs of tables, or unique to specific tables? 

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sku)
FROM skuinfo 
# 1564178

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sku)
FROM skstinfo 
# 760212

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sku)
FROM trnsact 
# 714499

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.sku)
FROM skuinfo s JOIN skstinfo
ON s.sku=skstinfo.sku
JOIN trnsact t
ON s.sku=t.sku;
# 542513

## (b) Use COUNT to determine how many instances there are of each sku associated with each store in the skstinfo table and the trnsact table? 

SELECT sku, store, COUNT(*)
FROM skstinfo
GROUP BY sku, store
ORDER BY sku ASC, store ASC;
# 39230146 Rows in total / 1 insatnce for each 

SELECT sku, store, COUNT(*)
FROM trnsact
GROUP BY sku, store
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
# 36099491 Rows in total / Max 7933 instances for sku # 4628597

## Exercise 2
## (a) Use COUNT and DISTINCT to determine how many distinct stores there are in the strinfo, store_msa, skstinfo, and trnsact tables. 

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM strinfo;
# 453

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM store_msa;
# 333

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM skstinfo;
# 357

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store)
FROM trnsact;
# 332

NumStores: strinfo > skstinfo > store_msa > trnsact

## (b) Which stores are common to all four tables, or unique to specific tables? 

SELECT s.store
FROM ((skstinfo s JOIN strinfo
ON s.store=strinfo.store)
JOIN trnsact t
ON strinfo.store=t.store)
JOIN store_msa
ON t.store=store_msa.store;

## Exercise 3
## Examine some of the rows in the trnsact table that are not in the skstinfo table;
## Can you find any common features that could explain why the cost information is missing?

## Exercise 4
## Although we can’t complete all the analyses we’d like to on Dillard’s profit, we can look at general trends. 
## What is Dillard’s average profit per day?

SELECT t.register, (SUM(t.amt-s.cost)/COUNT(DISTINCT t.saledate))
FROM skstinfo s JOIN trnsact t
ON s.sku=t.sku AND s.store=t.store
WHERE stype='P'
GROUP BY t.register;
# 10,779.20 for register # 6__ 

## Exercise 5
## On what day was the total value (in $) of returned goods the greatest? 
## On what day was the total number of individual returned items the greatest?

SELECT saledate,SUM(amt)
FROM trnsact 
WHERE stype='R'
GROUP BY saledate
ORDER BY SUM(amt) DESC;
# 04/12/27

SELECT saledate,SUM(quantity)
FROM trnsact 
WHERE stype='R'
GROUP BY saledate
ORDER BY SUM(quantity) DESC;
# 04/12/27

## Exercise 6
## What is the maximum price paid for an item in our database? 
## What is the minimum price paid for an item in our database?

SELECT MAX(SPRICE)
FROM TRNSACT;
# 6017.00

SELECT MIN(SPRICE)
FROM TRNSACT;
# 0.00

## Exercise 7
## How many departments have more than 100 brands associated with them, and what are their descriptions? 

SELECT s.dept, d.deptdesc, COUNT(s.brand)
FROM SKUINFO s, DEPTINFO d
WHERE s.dept=d.dept
GROUP BY s.dept, d.deptdesc
HAVING COUNT(s.brand) > 100
ORDER BY s.dept ASC;
# 60

## Exercise 8
## Write a query that retrieves the department descriptions of each of the skus in the skstinfo table. 

SELECT SKSTINFO.sku, DEPTINFO.deptdesc
FROM (SKSTINFO JOIN SKUINFO
ON SKSTINFO.sku=SKUINFO.sku) 
JOIN DEPTINFO
ON SKUINFO.dept=DEPTINFO.dept
GROUP BY SKSTINFO.sku, DEPTINFO.deptdesc
ORDER BY SKSTINFO.sku ASC;

## Exercise 9
## What department (with department description), brand, style, and color had the greatest total value of returned items? 

SELECT d.dept, d.deptdesc, s.brand, s.style, s.color, SUM(t.amt)
FROM trnsact t JOIN skuinfo s 
ON t.sku=s.sku
JOIN deptinfo d
ON s.dept=d.dept
WHERE t.stype='R'
GROUP BY d.dept, d.deptdesc, s.brand, s.style, s.color
ORDER BY SUM(t.amt);

## Exercise 10
## In what state and zip code is the store that had the greatest total revenue during the time period monitored in our dataset? 

SELECT s.state, s.zip, s.city, s.store, SUM(t.amt)
FROM strinfo s, trnsact t
WHERE s.store=t.store AND stype='P'
GROUP BY s.state, s.zip, s.city, s.store
ORDER BY SUM(t.amt) DESC;
